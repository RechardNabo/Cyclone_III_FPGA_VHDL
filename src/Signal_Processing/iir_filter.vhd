-- Project: FPGA-Optimized Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Filter
--
-- Description:
-- This VHDL module implements a high-performance Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter,
-- optimized for FPGA synthesis. IIR filters are crucial in digital signal processing
-- for applications requiring efficient filtering with a compact hardware footprint.
-- This design focuses on achieving high throughput and low latency, making it suitable
-- for real-time audio, image, and communication processing.
--
-- Learning Objectives:
-- 1. Understand the fundamental principles of IIR filter design and implementation.
-- 2. Learn how to translate IIR filter equations into synthesizable VHDL code.
-- 3. Explore techniques for fixed-point arithmetic implementation in FPGAs to manage
--    precision and resource usage.
-- 4. Implement pipelining and parallel processing strategies to maximize filter throughput.
-- 5. Develop a modular and scalable IIR filter architecture for various filter orders
--    and coefficient sets.
-- 6. Gain experience in designing control logic for data flow and coefficient loading.
--
-- Implementation Guidance:
-- 1. **Filter Structure**: Consider direct form I, direct form II, or transposed direct form II
--    structures. Transposed direct form II is often preferred for its pipelining advantages
--    and reduced register count.
-- 2. **Fixed-Point Representation**: Define the data width and fractional bits for input,
--    output, coefficients, and internal states to balance precision and hardware cost.
--    Utilize VHDL packages like 'fixed_pkg' for robust fixed-point operations.
-- 3. **Coefficient Storage**: Coefficients can be hardcoded or stored in Block RAMs (BRAMs)
--    for reconfigurability. Implement a mechanism to load coefficients if using BRAMs.
-- 4. **Multipliers and Adders**: Leverage FPGA DSP blocks (e.g., DSP48 slices in Xilinx,
--    DSP blocks in Altera/Intel FPGAs) for efficient multiplication. Pipelining these
--    operations is critical for high clock frequencies.
-- 5. **Pipelining**: Introduce pipeline stages between arithmetic operations (multiplications
--    and additions) to break down critical paths and increase the operating frequency.
-- 6. **Scaling and Overflow**: Implement scaling factors at various stages to prevent
--    overflow and maintain signal integrity, especially when dealing with feedback loops.
-- 7. **Reset and Initialization**: Ensure proper reset logic for all registers and state
--    elements, and consider initialization sequences for filter states.
-- 8. **Testbench Development**: Create a comprehensive testbench to verify the filter's
--    functionality, frequency response, and numerical accuracy using known input signals
--    and comparing against software-simulated results (e.g., MATLAB, Python SciPy).
--
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Architecture:
-- The IIR filter will typically consist of:
-- - Input/Output interfaces (e.g., AXI Stream, simple valid/ready handshake)
-- - Coefficient storage (registers or BRAM)
-- - Pipelined multiplier-accumulators (MAC units) for feedforward and feedback paths
-- - Delay elements (registers) for filter states
-- - Control logic for data processing and state updates
-- - Optional: Scaling and saturation logic
--
-- Example IIR Filter Equation (Direct Form II Transposed):
-- y[n] = b0*x[n] + b1*x[n-1] + ... + bm*x[n-m] - a1*y[n-1] - ... - an*y[n-n]
--
-- Where:
-- x[n] is the current input sample
-- y[n] is the current output sample
-- b_i are feedforward coefficients
-- a_i are feedback coefficients
-- m is the order of the feedforward part
-- n is the order of the feedback part
--
-- This VHDL template provides a basic structure. The actual implementation will
-- depend on the specific filter order, coefficients, and performance requirements.
